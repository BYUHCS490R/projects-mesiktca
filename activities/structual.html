<h2>Structual Tags</h2>
    <p><strong>What goes in the header?</strong> In the header we'll find the main title of the website or business and the logo.</p>
    <p><strong>What goes in the navigation?</strong> We'll find links for other parts of the websites. It's helpful to put links on the navigation bar for commonly search items. Like the apply button on BYUH website.</p><p>Navigation can go in the header, but it is not required. It is best practice for the navigation bar to be towards the top of the page, not the bottom. Navigation links should bring people to other parts of your website. You should keep traffic in your website. Navigation links that take people to other sites may cause loss of traffic.</p>
    <p><strong>what goes in the main?</strong> Under main we'll find the main content/articles</p>
    <p><strong>What goes in the footer?</strong>  In the footer we'll find other links that aren't commonly searched for like the website map, contact information, privacy information, legal information.</p>
