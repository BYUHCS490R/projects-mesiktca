        <p class="questions">What is unique about the PNG format?</p>
        <p></p> It doesn't lose quality and supports transparency. It is best for when clarity matters.
        <p class="questions">How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</p>
        <p></p> Download the image, open image in photo editor, resize button- resize image
        <p class="questions">Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </p>
        <p></p> If the file is done through CSS, then when the web loads the image will still be downloaded at hits full size and then resized which wastes data and bandwith.
