        <p>I have a big interest in traveling. I want to travel the world and see what's out there. I like learning about different cultures, different foods, and the different beautiful natural wonders around the world. Some places I want to visit are Iceland, Finland, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, and so much more. I hope to some day see the northern lights. Just for kicks and giggles, I'd like to dress up nice and walk through a fancy museum in Europe acting as though I am well-acquinted with world/art history.</p>
        <p>Another reason I love traveling is because I love airplanes. My mother traveled a lot when I was a young child, and she would bring me wherever she went whether for work travel or other purposes. My favorite part of tagging along side her was being able to see all the airplanes. I still love learning about planes and going to airshows. </p>
