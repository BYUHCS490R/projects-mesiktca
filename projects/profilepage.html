  <h1>Missy Carlson</h1> 
  <p>Hi! My name is Missy. I really enjoy the outdoors. You won't catch me hiking to the peak of the mountain. But you would find me looking up at the nightsky absolutely mesmerized. &#9789 Something about the infinite space above me makes me feel free. I love the sunrise and sunsets. If I'm not having a good day being in nature will cure me. Here are some things I hope for in regards to my love for nature.</p>
 <strong><ol type="A">
<li>Own a little sustainable farm</li>
<li>Own a nice big telescope</li>
<li>See the northern lights</li>
  </ol></strong>
<p>I also really love the Holiday season. I love Easter and the 4th, but the fall Holiday season takes the cake. I'm a sucker for all things pumpkin spice related. The neighborhood I grew up in threw block parties. One house sold the most amazing apple cider for 75&cent;. <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Spendlove claimed to have a super secret sauce he used- just to tease the kids. I love reading the <em>Harry Potter</em> series and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. I enjoy going to haunted houses and corn mazes.  I love the Christmas spirit. It warms my heart to see people donating and getting involved in community service during the Holiday season. </p>

<p>This is a favorite quote of mine because it is a family inside joke.In a competitive game of monopoly my father yelled this out in retort to the trash talk made against him. </p>
