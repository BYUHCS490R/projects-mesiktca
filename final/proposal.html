    <h1>Mesikt Carlson's Final Proposal</h1>
  </header>  
  <main>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Palau Planner</p>
    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> A demo website that allows users to look through hotels, transportation, and activities  in Palau. </p>
    <p><strong>Why?</strong> Most tourists book trips to Palau with a travel agency and packages. My brother had an idea to create a platform where tourists can easily browse through and book stay, transportation, and activity in one place. With his permission, I'm taking inspiration from his idea to for my final. He HAS NOT created/planned/designed this platform/website yet in any way, shape, or form. </p>
